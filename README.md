# laser-kit
Laser cut from plywood 200*200mm 3 mm thickness

## Description  
This is a study case for practicing in 3D modelling, creating surfaces for laser cut. 
I will try to complicate the task for myself and try to make a moving figure.

## 3d Modelling
By Rhinoceros 8. Main idea was that turning "key" you also can turn a hand. Basicly i thought about words in the cirle but modelling take a lot of my time and i forgot this idea.

Important to shop how i've made a gears. Designing gears that can rotate is not such an easy task. in order not to waste extra time, I found a workaround - a program that simulates gears.

this is a free software without installation where you design your gears. because i have no time to discover whole functions of it for export stl model - i've made a screenshot, took it in Rhino, circled and created a surface from which modeled 3D models. This programm i wil add in file directory in this repository.  

Also you can see how geaars can move by this software.
