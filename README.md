# laser-kit
Laser cut from plywood 200*200mm 3 mm thickness

## Description  
This is a study case for practicing in 3D modelling, creating surfaces for laser cut. 
I will try to complicate the task for myself and try to make a moving figure.

## 3d Modelling
By Rhinoceros 8. Main idea was that turning "key" you also can turn a hand. Basicly i thought about words in the cirle but modelling take a lot of my time and i forgot this idea.

Important to shop how i've made a gears. Designing gears that can rotate is not such an easy task. in order not to waste extra time, I found a workaround - a program that simulates gears.

this is a free software without installation where you design your gears. because i have no time to discover whole functions of it for export stl model - i've made a screenshot, took it in Rhino, circled and created a surface from which modeled 3D models. This programm i wil add in file directory in this repository.  

Also you can see how geaars can move by this software.

## Discussing  
Formally and in reality, the task was completed. But, despite the fact that the object and the gears are moving, there are several nuances why I do not consider the project 100% successful:  

1) Parts broke during their extrusion from the wooden plate - it was necessary to make the jumpers thinner;
   
2) Due to the fact that the connecting circles, which were supposed to hold the structure as a single whole, turned out to be too narrow - they broke and the gears moved apart on the plane;

3) it was worth making the lower circles, which I made in order to reduce friction of the indicators on the surface, with the same tolerance as the upper ones - they are too loose for me;  
   
4) at some point I was tired of this project and I needed moral strength to move on. I’m not sure that I’ll want to bring it to perfection, but the experience gained during the task was useful
